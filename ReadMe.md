Payroll Calculator

**Does not use any built in Time Libraries

This Java application so far consists of 2 classes. "payRoll" , and "time".
Contains Testing for each classes

Both Classes help user calculate how much time they have worked over an N day period.

Updates coming soon:
Ability to track Seconds (same logic as tracking minutes)
GUI instead of dull console input

Fixed 4/9,
Updated Logic for Minute Calculations

Much more coming :)
