Payroll Calculator

**Does not use any built in Time Libraries

This Java application so far consists of 2 classes. "payRoll" , and "time".
Both of which help user calculate how much time they have worked over an N day period.

Updates coming soon:
Ability to track Seconds (same logic as tracking minutes)
GUI instead of dull console input

Current Limitation(s) Known
Because Java does not divide (30/60) as (1/2) it is returning 0 instead of .5 \n
because of this, fractional hourly Gross pay does not compute accurately

Much more coming :)
