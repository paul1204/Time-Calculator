Payroll Calculator

**Does not use any built in Time Libraries

This Java application so far consists of 2 classes. "payRoll" , and "time".
Both of which help user calculate how much time they have worked over a 7 day period.

Updates coming soon:
Ability to track Seconds (same logic as tracking minutes)
Ability to switch between 7 day period or 14 day period

Much more;
